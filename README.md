Have created a search more like a fancy 3d calculator. and also have made 1 calc working which on the left. When you give input from the right calc it again goes to display of the left calc have made it so the user could be pranked a little bit. Also the design is 3d and more likely childish because that is picked from on of my maths textbook 📔.

## 📝 Features

- Console has no errors
- Tried 3d with after and before pseudo class and a bit of transform properties
- A good bg img
- Calc is completely working with remembering the prev operand
- Hosted on Netlify and set up in production
- Also Have catched all the exceptional cases for eg:-
            - when a number is divided by 0 instead of showing NaN my program shows ∞
            - Also when a operator like +, -, /, * is used without an operand it does not take input
            - Also if . is inputed multiple times it stops the user from doing so
- Used object oriented programming which i think reduces the lines of code to an amount and makes it more readable

## 😌 Honest Time to finish the project
I had took about 2hr 12min. Had put more effort on the css and used object oriented programming
